`gtR` is a tool for accessing UK Research and Innovation's (UKRI) [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) (GtR) API. It is designed to reduce repetitive code when calling the API via R. This also helps eliminates barriers to users who aren't familiar with APIs more generally.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/shanej90/gtR) using the following code:

``` {r install, eval = F }
remotes::install_github("shanej90/gtR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem (results aren't shown due to long character strings in data):

```{r example}
library(gtR)

# get list of projects
data <- get_resources(
  resource = "project",
  size = 10,
  page_num = 1
)


```

## Enhancements
Although the intention to expand this package's functionality over time, if you can't wait feel free to fork and add functionality. In this case you may find UKRI's [API documentation](https://gtr.ukri.org/resources/GtR-2-API-v1.7.5.pdf) useful.
