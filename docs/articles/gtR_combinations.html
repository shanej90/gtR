<p>The <code><a href="../reference/query_resource_all.html">query_resource_all()</a></code> function enables you to retrieve all records for a particular resource using a search term. If you want to limit the records returned to a specific institution, this requires additional arguments.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/query_resource_combination.html">query_resource_combination()</a></code> uses a list of defined combinations of resources (<code>gtr_combinations</code>) as well as an <code>id</code> argument to refine the records and only include those that match your resource combination and <code>id</code>.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="process">Process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#process"></a>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First you will need to check <code>gtr_combinations</code> to identify what resource combinations are required. The first resource in these combinations is what we will be filtering against using the <code>id</code> argument, and the second resource are the records that will be returned (eg. the “organisation project” combination will return all projects for a specific organisation, where the organisation is determined by the <code>id</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Next you need to retrieve the <code>id</code> that will be used to filter the resource. This can be done by using the <code>query_resource_all</code> function and making note of the <code>id</code> of the relevant record.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now use <code>query_resource_combination</code> function with the two resources found in <code>gtr_combinations</code> and the <code>id</code> retrieved from <code>query_resource_all</code>.</p></li>

Accurate flood warnings even just a few hours ahead can allow preparations to be made to minimize damage. In order to improve the prediction of these events, more accurate forecasts of heavy rainfall are needed, which can then be used to inform flood prediction and warning systems. The UK Met Office is developing a new numerical weather prediction system with the goal of improving severe weather forecasts. This is a computer model that solves mathematical equations representing atmospheric motions and other physical processes such as cloud formation, with a horizontal grid spacing of 1.5km. This allows a more accurate representation of fine-scale features and explicit representation of storms, but the results are still dependent on the accuracy of the starting conditions or initial data describing the current state of atmospheric variables such as winds, pressure, temperature and humidity. Initial conditions are usually estimated using a sophisticated mathematical technique known as data assimilation that blends observations with model information, taking account of the uncertainties in the data. In this project, we propose fundamental research to reduce initial condition errors. The work will be carried out in a partnership between the Universities of Reading, Surrey and the Met Office. \n\nWe plan to investigate ways of extracting the maximum information from weather radar observations of precipitation and moisture in the lower parts of the atmosphere. Although rainfall is usually well observed by weather radar, severe precipitation can cause the radar beam to lose energy, and thus the weaker returned signal may be misinterpreted, giving a lower rain-rate than in reality. We will develop algorithms to correct for this and other problems caused by severe rainfall. Recently, we have also developed techniques to infer humidity information about the lower atmosphere, and we plan to optimize the method and investigate the observation error characteristics, to prepare for this data to be assimilated by the Met Office. \n\nOne of our goals is to use observations to provide information on the small scales without degrading the large scale weather patterns, which are themselves likely to be accurate. However, currently much of the small scale observational information is being lost by ignoring correlations between observation errors. We will develop a generic approach for treating observation correlations for a range of observation types. We will investigate mathematical methods that both capture the maximum amount of information contained in the observations, while still being practical for operational computations, which have to take place within a limited time frame. \n\nAnother goal is to develop innovative ways of treating moist processes that are largely absent from present-day assimilation systems. We plan to design and test efficient and effective ways of assimilating moisture information that respect the intricate dynamical and physical relationships that operate in the atmosphere. If successful, such new approaches will allow better use of cloud and rain affected observations than at present.\n\nPredicting convective rain is made harder by the fact that some events are inherently unpredictable, even with good data assimilation and models, due to their high sensitivity to even small errors in the initial conditions. Further studies will be made to look at the dynamical reasons for the low predictability of such events using diagnostics derived from models and observations.</span>

The quality of the minerals or fossils extracted from the rocks directly impacts the data derived from their analyses. For example, for U-Th/He thermochronology, to interpret the 'cooling age' of a mineral requires knowledge of the crystals geometry, for other processes (cosmogenic nuclide dating) the puriting of the mineral separate that is dissolved to derive an exposure age, impacts the age uncertainty. Thus, for nearly all research applications, complete objects (as opposed to fragments) are highly preferable and often required. \n\nIncreasingly, researchers are getting samples from difficult to access places and the amount of material is limited. This applies to expeditions to remote locations where physical limits and logistics limit sample size, and in scientific drilling where the volume of material is limited by the width of the drill core. In these cases, ensuring maximum recovery of high-quality minerals or microfossils from smaller volumes of rock sample is really important. Often the cost of obtaining samples can be many thousands of pounds (considering a single drill core can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to drill, and recover). \n\nCommercial high-voltage fragmentation devices are now commercially available (SELFRAG). Such devices present three major advantages over conventional crushing and milling processes: \n\n(1) IMPROVED QUALITY OF MATERIALS liberated from rocks, whole crystals (as opposed to fragments) and microfossils can be routinely recovered enhancing subsequent analyses and derived science (see below). Experience in the community is that some rocks that SELFRAG separation can make the samples viable compared to non-viable with conventional crushing/milling;\n\n(2) FASTER PROCESSING TIMES - processing via SELFRAG vs. conventional crushing and milling is ~6x faster (30 minutes vs. 3 hours, including cleaning time) resulting in significant improvements in process efficiencies; \n\n(3) SMALLER SAMPLE VOLUMES REQUIRED - for regular rocks estimated that sample size can be reduced 2 to 3x due to the higher yields of high-quality mineral/micro-fossils. This is becoming increasingly important studies where sample size is limited, i.e., fieldwork in remote regions, or when working with samples from scientific drilling (e.g., International Ocean Discovery Program based research).; \n\n(4) 'Dust-free' fragmentation of rock effectively eliminating user exposure to dust and harmful substances (e.g., asbestos, naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM)). Processing of samples is carried out in water - a much reduced need for personal protection equipment and/or extraction related to dust.\n\nA high-voltage selective fragmentation device (SELFRAG) for the UK would provide the broad benefits outlined above to an entire research community, providing safer and more efficient ways of working, and improved quality of materials liberated from rocks that will directly improve subsequent analyses. \n\nFinally, this is a relatively new technology and new innovations are still be explored and developed, for example using high-voltage to study the energy required for rock failure, or using high-voltage fragmentation to experiment with materials recycling (i.e., what is the most effective way to fragment an iPhone and recover the rare elements for re-use).</span>

(These databases are familiar and ubiquitous, from lists of actors and creators in the Internet Movie Database or historical figures in Wikipedia, to private individuals via all sorts of social networking sites.) How does a researcher or analyst determine whether two records refer to the same person or are related in some other way, and whether other related information refers to both people equally? For this project we shall directly address these issues on a much smaller scale: there are very many historical prosopographies and onomastica (databases of persons and names), even within the relatively tight domain of Greco-Roman antiquity, and many of the same questions of identity and provenance apply. These databases can be worked on without the concerns raised by modern social network accounts: there are not the ethical and privacy concerns of working with living people; the scale, while still massive, is more tractable; there is much more academic coherence within the data, which, diverse as it is, is produced by a discipline with well-established working practices.\n\nThe SNAP project will pilot a new approach to working with diverse person data, using as a starting point three large datasets from the classical world: the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, an Oxford-based corpus of persons mentioned in ancient Greek texts; Trismegistos, a Leuven-run database of names and persons from Egyptian papyri; Prosopographia Imperii Romani, a series of printed books listing senators and other elites from the first three centuries of the Roman Empire. We shall model a simple structure using Web and Linked data technologies to represent relationships between databases and to link from references in primary texts to authoritative lists of persons and names. We shall invite new projects and datasets in the domain to participate in the SNAP network, to help us test the structures and contribute material on ancient people to the collection, and will help these projects to transform their data into a form that can be linked and annotated. We also plan to produce tools for illustration of the value of this data, and demonstrate research methods for working with the new material and information produced. The project will also show how to enhance and produce new data, generating new person references and links from classical texts that have not yet been looked at in this way (Greek and Latin inscriptions). We shall share our recommendations and our results through workshops, public conference papers, and a range of technical, academic and popular publications.</span>

The Truro Historical Project was originally designed to explore the city's history through the documents, artefacts and images that are found in the record offices, museums and similar institutions in the local area and beyond. These materials can illuminate much of the city's history, but they give only very limited insights into lives of the ordinary citizens of the city and, curiously, they are of limited help in revealing the period of intense change in Truro's very recent history since 1945. Anna Green of the Department of History at the University of Exeter's Cornwall Campus, not only has extensive experience of conducting and directing large-scale community oral histories, she is also responsible for the Public History stream of the syllabus, under which students undertake project and dissertation work with local museums and similar organisations. Green's expertise and ability to direct student project work in directions that could contribute significantly to illuminating the context of Truro's postwar history, suggest very clearly that a medium-sized community oral history project could extend our understanding of those aspects of Truro's history for which the documentary sources were most problematic. In selecting where and how many oral histories to undertake, the director of the Truro Historical Project and Green have elected to undertake life histories of the elderly residents of five postwar housing estates (originally built by the local authority) and to work in collaboration with Truro City Council's Community Development Partnership, which has made excellent progress on three of these estates and is looking to expand its activities on the other two. By collaborating with this initiative, the community worker can both introduce the historians to her elderly contacts, but also use the networks of the elderly to extend her own network and to make progress in developing community awareness and solidarity on the two 'new' estates. The Truro Historical project has already planned and budgeted for an exhibition in the city centre at the end of its term (summer 2010), but by adding a new element that celebrates the lives and contributions of those inhabitants that are most difficult to access and, even more important, by ensuring that the oral history element of the expanded exhibition can be taken to the community centres on these estates, this initiative will ensure that the primary goals of the Historical Project (an accessible, enjoyable history of the city) the Community Development Partnership (to empower the inhabitants of these estates and celebrate their contribution to Truro life) and of the University History Department (to work with the local community in constructive partnership) are met successfully.</span>

The UK NEA/NEAFO draws together a wealth of scientific evidence on the character, causes and consequences of ecosystem change and many of the concepts it deploys are central to future applications of natural and social science research. Yet government knows very little about how this path-breaking work reflects wider public aspirations and concerns about the natural environment, and how it is valued and managed. \n\nThe purpose of this dialogue project is thus to engage publics in a process of critically inspecting the concepts and key scientific findings of the NEA/NEAFO and their real and emerging applications in environmental decision making. Within this, the project considers the extent to which the policy response options reviewed by the NEA/NEAFO are considered credible by publics in the light of present challenges and future risks. \n\nThe dialogue process involves approximately 120 members of the general public interacting with policy and scientific researchers through a series of Regional Citizen Panels across the UK to evaluate NEA/NEAFO findings in a local context. The outcomes of this process will feed into a National Citizen Panel, where a cross section of dialogue participants will interact further with NEA stakeholders to refine and prioritize areas for the future development and application of NEA/NEAFO concepts and evidence.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 7  Europe and China both face the challenges of climate change and associated environmental degradation, and of finding ways in which to promote economic transition away from carbon-intensive economic and consumption patterns, and towards a green economy. The city is where these challenges are centred, and where solutions have to be found: cities are both producers of environmental externalities, and the locations where the negative effects of climate change will be felt most acutely. A promising approach focuses on treating new and existing cities as 'experimental areas' where transitions to a green economy can be trialled. Eco-cities and smart cities have been proposed as potential solutions to the need for a green economy: they are seen as 'socio-technical experiments' which are potential drivers for local, national and international environmental socio-economic change and transition.\n\nBoth China and several European countries are actively engaged in planning and building experimental cities focused on the green economy. Many of these projects combine elements of eco-city planning (focusing on the visible 'hardware' of environmental sustainability: planning, architecture, renewable energy and smart grid technologies, etc.), with 'smart city' planning (focusing is on 'software': information systems, social capital, knowledge transfer, etc.). We propose analysis of what we call the 'smart eco-city', defined as an experimental city which functions as a potential niche where both environmental and economic reforms can be tested and introduced in areas which are both spatially proximate (the surrounding region) and in an international context (through networks of knowledge, technology and policy transfer and learning).\n\nThe aim of this project is to provide the first systematic comparative analysis of green economy-focused eco-city projects in China and Europe. This will inform the identification of opportunities and pathways for shaping national and collaborative international urban and economic policy responses, engaging the state, the business sector and communities in delivering 'smart eco-city' projects that can promote the growth of the green economy.\n\nThe research addresses key issues: a.) how experimental cities have fared in terms of promoting successful transitions to a green economy in Europe and China since 2000; b.) how to evaluate success in smart eco-city initiatives; c.) what are the main obstacles to successful projects d.) what generalizable lessons can be drawn from successful smart eco-cities, in socio-economic and policy terms; e.) how knowledge can be effectively shared across the context of European and Chinese urban-economic policymaking for smart eco-cities.\n\nIn order to address these crucial issues our team will carry out international, interdisciplinary multi-method research which will include a total of eight in-depth smart eco-city case studies in China, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. This will involve documentary research as well as interviews with European and Chinese policymakers, businesspeople, financiers, local communities and other stakeholders. The project will also involve research aimed at building the first qualitative-quantitative database of smart eco-city projects: this will form the backbone of our policy toolkit and will be a state-of-the-art contribution to current knowledge on smart- and eco-city planning and policy.\n\nOur expected outcomes are: 1.) the first systematic comparative study of smart eco-city projects in Europe and China; 2.) the identification of criteria for the success of experimental city projects in stimulating the emergence and growth of the green economy; 3.) a true interdisciplinary partnership between China and Europe in the generation of new knowledge and data; 4.) the generation of new theory in the field of transition theory; and 5.) policy toolkits of use for beneficiaries involved in contemporary experimental smart eco-city projects.</span>

Through a critical engagement with current debates in the anthropology of Islam, it will challenge homogenous categorisations of Muslims, \nand destabilise privileged frameworks, proposing a novel framework that will pay more attention to ethical complexity. \n\nThe scholarship of Islam and moral life, whilst expansive and reflective, unduly privileges the role of modernity in determining and understanding moral life. Questions concerning loyalty towards Islamic \nmovements, the role of resonance with the unseen, and notions of what it means to live a good life against a background of negotiating legitimacy and conflict, are essential in destabilising this privileging. \nThese questions are central for understanding the moral lives of Muslims in contexts in which they are generally seen as (1) responding to modernity through a process of &amp;quot;radicalisation&amp;quot;, and (2) impacted \nprimarily by ethical norms determined by the values of modernity. This thesis will argue that new and more nuanced perspectives concerning moral life and Islam can be obtained by decentring this axis of \nmodernity. Broadening the question of moral life in this way, the proposed research aims to consider the ways in which intra-religious conflict plays a primary role in shaping the everyday interactions of Islamic moral life, through dynamics which are not principally bound by modern values. Therefore, the key research question this thesis seeks to address is, &amp;quot;How is moral life shaped in the experience of intra-religious conflict?&amp;quot;\n\nThe Covid-19 situation permitting, primary research will be gathered through ethnographic fieldwork. The aforementioned questions lend themselves to ethnography, as observations of everyday discourses, religious ceremonies, practices and lectures, and local media, will play an essential role in uncovering the lived realities of everyday ethics. For example, Thurston notes that canonical splits in the Salafi community often occur during Friday sermons. Therefore, it will be essential to attend Friday sermons (usually performed in Arabic and repeated English), along with classes and lectures, and interact with participants within and outside mosques. \n\nFieldwork will be carried out in Accra and Tamale, as they will provide localities of axis and engagement to examine intra-religious interactions and the contextualisation of politics and power, and a base to \naccess participants and spaces of the everyday. Specific institutions include the Accra Furqan National Mosque, which houses the Office of the National Chief Imam (the Tijaniyya central hub and Islamic \nrepresentative of Muslims in Ghana), and the Afa Ajura Mosque in Tamale (a key location of the ASwJ movement, named after the eminent Ghanaian Salafi imam). These institutions, the primary sites of Friday sermons and lectures, are public and generally accessible. Mosque imams will be contacted, and if consent is given, would act as gatekeepers once the details of the fieldwork are explained and discussed. Further, if institutional access is granted on the grounds of transparency, regular mosque-goers will be asked to participate in interviews and observation, if consent is given after participant \nconfidentiality is assured. \n\nAlthough English is the national and most spoken language in Ghana, beginners' Dagbani classes will be taken through the free online initiative learndagbani.org prior to fieldwork, as it is widely spoken alongside English as the local language of Tamale.</span>

IPCC authors have expressed that effective mitigation on climate change would require &amp;quot;removing barriers in social and institutional processes&amp;quot;. To help address this challenge, I propose the development of new ways to measure the political narratives that perpetuate and sustain these social and institutional barriers. \nMany researchers in social science have sought to pick apart the various patterns of misinformation and scepticism in online forums and on social media platforms. I intend to expand on this by addressing political narratives for both sceptic and activist perspectives on climate change. The proposed thesis will attempt to offer a first attempt at meeting this objective by making the following theoretical and methodological contributions:\n Instead of looking specifically at how arguments stray from scientific truth, I am interested in establishing a baseline of 'narrative reasoning' for both conservative/sceptic and activist perspectives on climate change. Narrative reasoning establishes who is responsible for transgressions and why (what have they done?). How far do political actors stray for the political narratives they are associated with? What does this tell us about public opinion and how it shifts? Does narrative reasoning for one issue effect another (e.g. positions on public health (Covid-19) and positions on Climate Change)? \n Research into the imagery of Climate Change presents new ways to study narratives. Saffron O'Neill's research shows that climate imagery has increasingly focused on people rather than on the more traditional focus on polar bears and melting permafrost. \no Image oriented approaches open new avenues for research and allow for the exploration of social media data beyond the convenience of Twitter towards sites like Instagram and Facebook. The availability of Facebook/Instagram data has always been limited in comparison to Twitter data, however recent political developments have led to certain transparency measures such as the Facebook Advertisement API, allowing for the collection of advertisement and event data. Climate communications researchers have called for a diversification in social media data, particularly as platforms such as Facebook more active user accounts to most other social media platforms. \n This research builds and expands on the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF); a policy specific framework to measure narratives objectively (in contrast to more interpretive approaches). In a paper from 2018, NPF researchers expressed a desire for the creation of 'big narrative datasets', whilst also expressing the potential limitations of using automated techniques in identifying narrative elements. My research will utilise a variety of Natural Language Processing techniques and novel methods for the analysis of large image datasets to address and overcome these limitations. \n I intend to build ethical considerations into my research. The use of social media data presents a variety of ethical issues, such as the use of private vs public data and the use of facial recognition libraries on images obtained from social media platforms.\n My research fits into the EI remit by using social data to address environmental challenges, namely; using data science methodologies to understand how climate change is communicated across sceptical and activist space, then using this information to support climate focused organisations in developing novel ways to communicate climate change effectively so as to counteract ideologically driven scepticism.</span>

A\nfamous example is in the much celebrated quantum Hall effect, where the resistance in the\nmaterial surprisingly plateaus at certain integer values. This intriguing phenomenon can be\nunderstood elegantly through topological numbers known as Chern numbers.\n\n\nWe have so far only talked about conventional materials, which are primarily governed by the\nbehaviour of their constituent electrons. However, much less is known when it is the particle\nof light (the photon) which instead plays an important role in the system. In the field of\nquantum nanophotonics, we are concerned with nanoscale materials where the light-matter\ninteraction is decisive. In particular, in the strong light-matter coupling regime, electrons and\nphotons may hybridize to form a new particle, carrying desirable traits of both of its component\nparts.\n\n\nThis sets the stage for the proposed project, which aims to make fundamental mathematical\nadvances in topological quantum nanophotonics. Namely, inspired by the success of topological\ntheories in describing electronic systems, we will develop theories to describe and exploit\ntopological light at the nanoscale. We will develop topological invariants capable of\ndescribing bosonic particles such as light, and create models which explain how topological\nlight may be used in the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum circuitry,\ncommunications and information.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 1                                                                                                                                                The primary impact of this project will be on the ability of the Met Office to forecast high impact rainfall, and on downstream systems and users of those forecasts. \n\nProposed work on improving the quality and accuracy of radar reflectivity measurements and derived rainfall estimates will have impact in a number of ways. Firstly, there will be an immediate impact via the Met Office STEPS/UKPP numerical weather prediction (NWP) post-processing system. This objectively merges extrapolation forecasts with output from numerical weather prediction (currently the 1.5 km grid-spacing model, updated every 3 h, at best) to produce an 'optimal' forecast every hour. The output is used to drive hydrological models by the Environment Agency; in particular, it is used to drive the G2G model operated within the Joint Met Office/ Environment Agency Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC), which gives a national view of short-term flood risk, including un-gauged catchments. It is also used as guidance for the Extreme Rainfall Alerts, along with the UK convective-scale ensemble system, UK-MOGREPS. Improved radar-derived rainfall will also have a direct impact on the quality of the NWP forecast, as rainfall is assimilated and, incidentally, enable a more useful verification of any rainfall forecasts to be performed. \n\nLonger term improvements will come primarily through the implementation of a nowcasting configuration of the NWP system. This could become a replacement input into STEPS/UKPP and so naturally feed through to the same users. The Met Office have a key deliverable of their Public Weather Service R&amp;amp;D plan to have an 'Operational implementation of next-generation NWP-nowcasting system' by March 2017. This would potentially include implementation of direct assimilation of radar reflectivity by 4DVAR rather than rainfall via latent heat nudging. This brings advantages of consistency and coupling to model dynamics, but will benefit enormously from the more accurate data, the better characterization of their errors and the more efficient use of data via improved representation of error covariance structure provided by this project. The latter will also have impact through better use of the information in the radar Doppler wind data and satellite observations already assimilated. \n \nThe NWP-based nowcasting system would also be the route through which the other main outputs of the project deliver impact, though they would also have impact in the existing NWP system if the nowcasting system were delayed. Use of radar refractivity provides a major source of low-level humidity information, vital for good forecasts of high-impact rainfall. This information is currently very sparse, mainly coming from surface synoptic stations but increasingly from aircraft as the land and take off from major airports. While we cannot predict the amount of forecast improvement, we know that deficiencies in low level moisture are a major contributor to forecast error.\n\nA better (and more adaptive) choice of moisture-variable(s) in the Data Assimilation system will have impact on the assimilation system, especially assimilation of refractivity and reflectivity (for which it may prove essential); this is a current goal in the Met Office's rolling plan for improvements.\n\nMany of these impacts will also have benefit for other forecast systems; techniques to model observation error covariance will be applicable in other systems and to other observation types. Application of refractivity will also be applicable in other radar systems.\n\nOf course, the ultimate aim of this project is impact on the public (and thus the insurance industry) through improved flood warnings, especially of pluvial and fluvial flooding of small, fast-response catchments. This will bring benefits through reduced loss of life and damage to property.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 3                The SELFRAG Lab Facility will represent innovation in: \n\nProcess Efficiencies - Higher yield from smaller samples e.g. drill core (ICDP, IODP, UKGEOS, industry). Process is 2-3x quicker compared to conventional crushing and milling methods, therefore more time for research. Process efficiencies are a major UKRI drive.\n\nScience application area broadening. Materials science and resource management e.g. extracting critical metals from recycling of mobile phones, are relevant to NERC's investment in Resource Recovery and Waste. Material purification currently uses microwave technology but could use SELFRAG (see University of Nottingham PP letter). SELFRAG can be used as a testbed for a novel communition process (see PP letter from Leicester) within the mineral extraction process to enhance the liberation of complex minerals from ore, reducing the environmental impact of e-tech resource extraction.\n\nHealth and Safety. Occurring in water, the SELFRAG process produces essentially zero dust offering a safer process for operators (e.g. from silicosis, asbestosis). Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) may also be handleable. Containing and constraining the preparation of such materials, if this represents a practical way of working with them, will allow a wider variety of materials to be researched.\n\nImpact will be measured through an annual survey to users (and potential users), monitoring user satisfaction and recording outputs (i.e., publications) that have resulted from the use of the UK SELFRAG Lab system.\n\nHealth and Safety is a major concern for many UK HEI and Research Centres involved with crushing and milling of rocks. Whilst measures are put in place to minimise the exposure to dust using extraction systems and personal protection equipment, the most effective way to minimise risk is to eliminate the source of the hazard. SELFRAG operates with the sample in water, effectively making it dust free. Eliminating the risk will prevent any future dust-based injury or sickness claims on the public purse.\n\nElectro-fragmentation significantly reduces the amount of energy required for rock comminution. Research into the development of lower impact ore exploration and extraction (Leicester PP) could generate more cost effective, efficient and lower energy processes for natural resource exploration for UK industry, directly benefiting the UK economy and contributing towards energy-use reduction targets for the UK.\n\nThe NERC Services &amp;amp; Facilities work with the research community including NERC Research Centres (see PP letter Murton NOC) to solve scientific problems and generate publishable peer-reviewed output. As a NERC Facility, the NEIF user-community will benefit directly from this instrumentation with &amp;gt;30 papers/a likely benefiting. A significant proportion of these will derive from the network of geochronology researchers within the UK who will benefit additionally from the unique science opportunities a SELFRAG Lab will bring. Access to this instrumentation at a free-at-the-point-of-access Facility (and through pay-as-you-go) will significantly strengthen the geochronology-based collaborations already occurring within the UK. Potential beneficiaries will be the materials science, recycling and radioactive waste communities where electro-fragmentation offers clear possibilities as well as the civil engineering community whom fundamental investigations of rock mechanics would benefit. This will broaden the reach of this NERC Facility to other science funding bodies (STFC, EPSRC) where there are mutual synergies in the science. Another key output will be the increased interfacing with industry where this technology offers distinct advantages and where a SELFRAG Lab Facility at the BGS could be used as a testbed for capability development. For example, critical damage threshold analysis and the energy required for disaggregation, mining and tunnelling could be investigated using SELFRAG.</span>

Even beyond the immediate academic beneficiaries of this historical data, the release of this collected dataset and the related methodologies and models will impact on related fields (history, literature, narratology, comparative mythology), corporations (including publishers and developers) and cultural heritage institutions working with person, name and person-like data. The project will be directly engaging with these groups to gain feedback and peer-review in the models and methods being developed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and to promote and aid the publication of additional datasets. Cultural heritage institutions, archives and publishers in particular will benefit from the enhancement of their data through connection to the graph and through the driving of new traffic to their materials (including paywalled data) through the links and relationships surfaced by the project.\n\nThe publication of the resulting dataset to the Linked Open Data cloud has the potential to interconnect or more richly connect existing datasets already in the cloud. It also represents a network of referenced people and people-like entities which mirror the social datasets currently being studied by sociologists and web scientists but without the ethical and privacy issues which are inherent in modern datasets. Working with historic datasets can enable investigations of social interactions and expression in a way not otherwise possible and then apply the lessons and experience to the wider linked data network. This research into social networks is not only an academic activity, but is also key to many areas of the Web industry: all of the major search engines, social networks, spam management and advertising professionals engage in this kind of study. The larger project of which SNAP serves as a pilot will directly impact these larger questions as well as engaging with genealogy companies and enthusiasts. At this stage of focusing on classical materials, the value of the data to the general public will be illustrated through user-friendly web presence and tools for non-academic study of ancient names and naming conventions.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The public dialogue project exercise will help inform implementation of the Defra Natural Environment White Paper as well as influence Research Council decisions, projects and programmes, addressing issues such as the links between human health and wellbeing and ecosystem services. The work will also provide valuable background input for Foresight studies and TSB initiatives. Other LWEC partners likely to benefit include the funders of the NEAFO, the Department of Health, Forestry Commission, Natural England, equivalent bodies in devolved administrations and the Department for Communities and Local Government and its associated local authorities. The outcomes of the public dialogue will have particular relevance to the specific departmental policy developments including:\n\n* Defra: The Department is committed in particular to embedding UK NEA science in a range of policy areas as part of its Action Plan for embedding an 'ecosystems approach' in to decision making. This includes the development of payment for ecosystem services schemes, the piloting of biodiversity offsetting, the delivery of 'Local Nature Partnerships' and large scale nature restoration projects, such as the 'Nature Improvement Areas'.\n\n* Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG): Better understanding and engagement with science may lead to more efficient approaches to environmental management through improved understandings of the opportunity spaces within the National Planning Policy framework including the recognition of value of ecosystem services and through the delivery of the localism agenda within neighbourhood plans and wider championing of community ownership of assets and services. The 'golden thread' of sustainable development will also have a stronger more robust policy framework which will increasingly be used in planning decisions and consultations in the absence of any statutory plan.\n\n* Department of Business Innovation and Skills: Better understanding and engagement with the Local Enterprise Partnerships who are now assuming strategic planning roles. The linkages with local planning authorities are being developed set within novel ideas of a single funding pot for delivery. At the heart of these should be the recognition of the environment as a key asset in delivery of economic growth.\n\n* Department of Energy and Climate Change: One of the policy contexts in which the UK NEA science sits is to link issues of ecosystems change to wider debates of energy security and responses to climate change.\n\nIn addition the dialogue work will build on and complement the public dialogue work that Sciencewise has already supported through the LWEC Citizen's Advisory Forum and the Natural England Nature Improvement Areas public dialogues. The LWEC Advisory Forum (July 2010 to March 2011) focused on climate change and flooding but one of its recommendations was that public engagement should be supported at an 'up-stream' level, where research strategies are still emergent, and where the maturity of an agenda allows the public to consider a broader range of possible solutions and approaches with greater rationality (as in the NEAFO). The Natural England Nature Improvement Areas public dialogues have just begun (April 2013 to March 2015) and present a more devolved model of public dialogue with engagement being co-ordinated by local partnerships and focusing specifically on biodiversity and local management strategies. The NEAFO dialogue work will take a more structured methodology and look at a wider range set of issues, and it will be interesting to compare findings as the projects progress along a similar timeline.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 7  The project will have an impact in informing policymaking as well as business and community engagement in and around experimental smart eco-city projects in the UK, other European countries and in China. Our research project involves sustained and detailed engagement with beneficiaries in the UK, China, the Netherlands, France and Germany, and will have an impact on:\n\nPolicy beneficiaries: in the UK these will be a.) policymakers at the national level, especially those concerned with urban and economic planning, or with environmental planning (e.g. Department for Communities and Local Government; Department for Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs); b.) private sector-focused government bodies, such as UK Trade and Industry; c.) local government bodies at the level of individual case studies, including local councils. These beneficiaries will benefit from engagement in the project through published outputs and from attendance at community-focused stakeholder impact workshops (see 'community beneficiaries' below), policy workshops, funded attendance at international practitioner-academic conferences such as the UN World Urban Forum summit in 2016; and the project website and webinars. \n\nBusiness beneficiaries: UK businesses such as urban development and design firms, engineering corporations, or consultancies, and including industry-focused bodies such as the China-Britain Business Council. Business beneficiaries will benefit from published, workshop and webinar impact mechanisms mentioned above (in the discussion on policy beneficiaries), as well as from a specific, business-focused output: an Executive Summary Report targeting business impact, informed through engagement with businesspeople and corporations throughout the project's lifetime, therefore making sure that the report targets topics, issues and solutions relevant to UK businesses. \n\nCommunity beneficiaries: these will include local community stakeholders at case study sites. These beneficiaries represent those who will be most directly affected by smart eco-city planning projects and policies. It is expected that most of these beneficiaries will be (in the UK) located in and around the Thames Gateway Eco-Region case study sites. Community beneficiaries will include NGOs, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. They will benefit from all the activities mentioned above, with a particular focus on the stakeholder impact meetings, which will be held at case study sites during case study research: in the UK, these meetings will mostly be in and around the Thames Gateway regions, and will focus on local stakeholders from communities and civil society organizations (as well as local government).\n\nPolicy, business and community beneficiaries will benefit from the provision made within the project for these beneficiaries to participate at stakeholder impact meetings; policy workshops in London and Beijing; and at panels and conference discussion sessions to be held at the UN World Urban Forum summit in 2016 and at the Eco-Cities World Summit in 2017, featuring engagement with academic and policy audiences, as well as with businesses. These events will see beneficiary attendees from other European countries and from China, funded by respective national project teams, and will therefore be key knowledge sharing, mutual learning and networking opportunities for policymakers, businesses and community stakeholders. Those beneficiaries participating in policy workshops in China will benefit from case study site visits to selected smart eco-cities, enabling on-the-ground policy and practice learning.\n\nFinally, we aim to achieve broader societal impact through enabling the construction of cleaner and smarter urban economies and environments, thus helping to ensure successful smart eco-city projects, the emergence of a sustainable green economy, and better, more prosperous, and environmentally resilient communities.</span>
