Examples in common use include tests for detecting HIV and hepatitis, for diagnosing thyroid hormone abnormalities, or for differentiating heart attacks from other conditions such as angina which may display similar symptoms. New immunoassays are under development all the time, e.g. to improve the detection of cancer tumours or to monitor factors associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nImmunoassays rely on the successful chemical &amp;quot;labelling&amp;quot; of antibodies and related proteins, so for example that they can be detected efficiently via the presence of a fluorescent dye - and Fleet are expert in the bioconjugation techniques required for this purpose. Fleet routinely use simple analytical techniques to characterise these labelled antibody conjugates, allowing us to determine basic information such as the antibody concentration and the mean number of dye molecules per antibody molecule.\n\nHowever these techniques tell us nothing about whether the labelled antibody conjugate has retained its ability to detect the molecule of interest, or has been damaged in the labelling process. For example it is possible to attach too many dye molecules to an antibody, with the result that its ability to bind the target molecule is compromised. It would be very useful to have access to a rapid, inexpensive analytical method allowing us to confirm that the conjugate has successfully retained its structure during the labelling procedure.\n\nFleet have evaluated several techniques for this purpose, but to date all have failed to meet our requirements; simple techniques based on spectroscopy which would meet our needs of being rapid and inexpensive have not shown adequate sensitivity to differentiate between &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; conjugates, while techniques capable of achieving the required sensitivity have proved prohibitively expensive and/or time-consuming.\n\nAn initial project with LGC and NPL (completed in March 2019) identified techniques with exciting potential to fill this knowledge gap, and to better understand the mechanism of conjugate inactivation. This follow-up project aims to confirm the potential of these techniques. Fleet will prepare a range of antibody conjugates for evaluation and assess them in a model immunoassay, while LGC and NPL will characterise them using a range of candidate analytical techniques. This will hopefully allow us to confirm the capability of these techniques for routine use by Fleet Bioprocessing Ltd.</span>

This project brings together buildings and activities for the first time developing and implementing a cutting-edge AI-based control and decision support system for non-domestic properties based on detailed Building Management and HVAC system integration. The project then utilises a detailed disaggregate building and process model to develop a costed pathway to net zero tailored to the specific environment &amp;amp; activities. &amp;quot;5D&amp;quot; refers to the three spatial dimensions, the use of AI based on time-series data, and the 5th dimension being business processes/activities.</span>

Most of the offshore wind turbines installed to date are located in relatively shallow water and are mounted on fixed bottom support structures. Given the limitation of suitable shallow water sites available with high wind resources and also to reduce the environmental and visual impact of turbines, it is necessary to extend wind turbines to deeper water through the development of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) systems, which mount wind turbines on floating support platforms. \n\nThe project aims to fill an important gap in the design, manufacturing and testing of emerging FOWT techniques by specifically characterising extreme loading on FOWTs under complex and harsh marine environments. These are typically represented by storm conditions consisting of strong wind, extreme waves, significant current, rising sea level and complex interplay between these elements, through a coordinated campaign of both advanced CFD modelling and physical wave tank tests. This has direct relevance to the current and planned activities in the UK to develop this new technology in offshore wind. \n\nIn addition, the project aims to develop a suite of hierarchical numerical models that can be applied routinely for both fast and detailed analysis of the specific flow problem of environmental (wind, wave, current) loading and dynamic responses of FOWTs under realistic storm conditions. As an integral part of the project, a new experimental programme will be devised and conducted in the COAST laboratory at the University of Plymouth, providing improved understanding of the underlying physics and for validating the numerical models. Towards the end of the project, fully documented CFD software and experimental data sets will be released to relevant industrial users and into the Public Domain, so that they may be used to aid the design of future support structures of FOWTs and to secure their survivability with an extended envelope of safe operation for maximum power output.</span>

Adaptive Optics can be used to counteract the detrimental effects of the Earth's atmosphere and restore sharp images. It is only by developing advanced optical instrumentation, such as Adaptive Optics systems, that we can enable the next generation of astronomical discoveries. Here, we propose a collaborative project between Durham University, UK, and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand. This proposal not only aims to strengthen links between Thai and UK instrumentation communities, but also through the joint development of an AO system testbench build a domestic advanced astronomical instrumentation capability within Thailand. This not only has benefits directly to astronomy, but will form the core of an instrumentation training faciilty that can be used to provide students and engineers with experience of developing and operating automated opto-mechanical instrumentation. AO system development provides experience within a huge range of fields, including optical metrology, machine-vision, computer automation and high-speed computing. Such skills are in high demand within many sectors of Thai economy where much of the advanced technical knowledge and instrumentation is currently licensed or purchased from overseas.\n\nThe proposed research includes using advanced techniques developed at some of the worlds premier observatories to fully characterise the Thai National Observatory (TNO) site. This part of the project will involve UK and Thai researchers working together with dedicated atmospheric characterisation instrumentation as well as analysing weather forecasts to develop dynamic models of the atmosphere above the observatory. Once the model has been validated with on-site measurements, archived weather forecast data will be used to make a statistical analysis of the site quality. Large datasets will need to be processed in an efficient manor by the collaboration, further training Thai researchers in data acquisition, handling and analysis.\n\nThe TNO site will then be evaluated to determine the most effective type of Adaptive Optics system based on expected atmoshperic conditions. This phase will involve configuring and running computer simulations of various instruments to see which will ultimately deliver the science that best aligns with the research interests of NARIT. We will finally jointly develop an instrument prototype which is capable of correcting for the Earth's turbulence. This prototype will be used to undertake experimentation regarding adaptive optics control techniques and will be designed such that it will also be compatible with the interface to the TNO 2.4m telescope for on-sky demonstration.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 9  This proposal seeks to understand how a prodigious 1,250 km runout submarine sediment avalanche (turbidity current) was triggered on 14th January 2020, by the largest flood in 50 years along the Congo River. This submarine flow broke two seabed telecommunication cables that underpin data traffic to West Africa causing the internet to slow from Nigeria to South Africa. These submarine cables had not previously broken in the last 20 years. This flow also caused a series of oceanographic moorings to surface, placed along Congo Submarine Canyon by a NERC project (NE/R001952). Cable breaks and surfaced moorings show that this remarkable flow ran out for over 1,200 km, as measured along the canyon axis. Moreover, the flow continuously self-accelerated, such that it reached front speeds of &amp;gt;8 m/s, some 1,150 to 1,250 km from its source at the mouth of the Congo River. This is the longest runout turbidity current yet monitored in action, and the only monitored flow to continuously self-accelerate for over a thousand kilometres. \n\nIt is important to understand how such powerful and very long runout turbidity currents are triggered, especially for hazards to strategic seabed cables, including cable routes that are planned for 2020-21 off West Africa. The January 14-16th submarine flow is not associated with an earthquake, and it occurred during a period of low wave heights. However, it does coincide with an extreme flood of 80,000 m3s-1 observed in December 2019 along the Congo River. It is thus also important to determine how the frequency of submarine flows will be effected by future climate and hydrological changes in the Congo Basin. Here we seek to understand how this exceptional river flood triggered a thousand kilometre submarine flow, by conducting a detailed survey of the Congo River mouth. We will use the geomorphology of that river-to-submarine-canyon transition to understand how the offshore flow was triggered by the river flood, for example by mapping landslide scars, or testing a hypothesis that river bedload was driven over a single steep avalanche face. This is an urgency grant because evidence of how the Jan 2020 flow was triggered (e.g. seabed failure scarps) will be buried or wiped-out by the next peak discharge of the Congo River in Oct 2020.\n\nThere are extremely few direct measurements of the most powerful turbidity currents that run out for hundreds to thousands kilometres to the deep ocean, and the few measurements available previously produced step changes in understanding. Indeed, there has only been one previously directly-measured turbidity current on this scale, which is the Grand Banks event in 1929 that broke all ~20 cables across the N. Atlantic. The Grand Banks event ran out for over 800km, but decelerated from 19 m/s to 3 m/s, rather than continuously accelerating as in the Jan 2020 event. Moreover, the Jan 2020 event already has much more detailed measurements from the timing of offshore moorings, with further data to come via recovery of these moorings and 12 OBS (with hydrophones and geophones) on a NERC cruise. This Jan 2020 event is thus a rare and extremely valuable opportunity to understand how far large-scale flows operate, linked to exceptional river floods with much longer (50-100 year) recurrence intervals. \n\nThe main gap in our understanding of the Jan 2020 event is what happened at the river mouth, and this is key for predicting flow frequency and links to climate change. The geomorphology of the river to canyon-head transition is currently unknown. For example, UKHO bathymetric charts mainly use data collected in the 1890s. Here we will use swath multibeam echosounder systems to survey the river to canyon transition at much higher resolution and in three dimensions, thereby documenting its geomorphology in unprecedented detail. Past work shows how a single multibeam bathymetric survey can produce major insights into turbidity currents triggering at river mouths.</span>

This Seedcorn project will establish collaboration between researchers from Uganda and the UK with expertise in climate, forest and livelihoods analysis. The Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) approach underpins international commitments to restore degraded landscapes such as the Bonn Challenge to restore 350 million hectares of forest worldwide by 2030, with the aim of delivering climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as biodiversity benefits and enhancement of livelihoods. The FLR framework provides a list of different restoration activities that can be chosen depending on local circumstances, including plantations for harvest, forestry within agricultural systems (agroforestry), natural regeneration and mixed compositions of forest and agricultural or pastoral lands. The sensitivity and resilience of these different FLR activities to future climate impacts will vary and have profound implications for the resilience of local livelihoods. \nThis project will take an interdisciplinary approach to assess the resilience of three different types of FLR undertaken at Environmental Conservation Trust of Uganda (EcoTrust) sites in Macinde, Uganda to climatic impacts. The three types of FLR are: agroforestry, plantations and natural regeneration. The research plan is split into three work packages: forest restoration stakeholder engagement and identification of research needs through a participatory workshop; synthesis of historical data on ecology, rainfall and livelihoods under different FLR approaches to assess their resilience to climatic variation in the past, as a guide to future sensitivity; and establishment of long-term monitoring of ecological and socio-economic outcomes of the different types of FLR in Macinde, Uganda. The collection and analysis of data from these FLR sites will build an important and unique dataset which will form the basis of future collaborative research proposals working with local forest restoration stakeholders to improve resilience of the landscape and livelihoods that depend on it.\nThese activities deliver against the aims of the Seedcorn Fund by developing a new international collaboration with leading researchers in tropical forest landscape restoration (Dr Bernard Obaa &amp;amp; Dr Sarah Akello of Makerere University) and implementing partners on the ground (Pauline Nantongo, EcoTrust) as well as climate and livelihoods data synthesis (Prof Rosalind Cornforth &amp;amp; Dr Celia Petty of the Walker Institute, Moses Tumusiime of the Uganda National Meteorological Authority). All partners contribute specific intellectual expertise which together will build a multi-disciplinary research team, with the capacity to deliver research at the cutting edge of climate, forest and livelihoods fields. The Walker Institute contributes climate and livelihoods data synthesis, knowledge exchange and policy engagement. The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at Makerere University, Uganda contributes technical forestry, restoration and ecological monitoring expertise. EcoTrust contributes expertise in financial flows, community engagement and participatory approaches to forest landscape restoration, as well as ecological monitoring. The Uganda National Meteorological Agency contributes expertise in weather and climate data monitoring, through Rainwatch-Uganda. This new team will provide a basis for long-term collaboration to assess resilience of restoration projects, through establishment of long-term monitoring at field sites in Uganda where novel multi-disciplinary research into climatic changes, ecological and livelihoods resilience can be conducted.</span>
