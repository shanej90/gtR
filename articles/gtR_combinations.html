<p>The <code>query_resource_all</code> function enables you to retrieve all records for a particular resource using a search term. If you want to limit the records returned to a specific institution, this requires additional arguments.</p>
<p><code>query_resource_combination</code> uses a list of defined combinations of resources (<code>gtr_combinations</code>) as well as an <code>id</code> argument to refine the records and only include those that match your resource combination and <code>id</code>.</p>

<li><p>First you will need to check <code>gtr_combinations</code> to identify what resource combinations are required. The first resource in these combinations is what we will be filtering against using the <code>id</code> argument, and the second resource are the records that will be returned (eg. the “organisation project” combination will return all projects for a specific organisation, where the organisation is determined by the <code>id</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Next you need to retrieve the <code>id</code> that will be used to filter the resource. This can be done by using the <code>query_resource_all</code> function and making note of the <code>id</code> of the relevant record.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now use <code>query_resource_combination</code> function with the two resources found in <code>gtr_combinations</code> and the <code>id</code> retrieved from <code>query_resource_all</code>.</p></li>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2  Fungal infections have a major impact on human health. Pathogenic (disease causing) fungi cause life-changing oral, genital and skin infections, and life-threatening systemic infections affecting internal organs. Most individuals carry the fungus Candida albicans in their microflora. Normally our immune system recognises invading Candida cells and kills them, thereby protecting us from infection. However, Candida infections arise when the efficiency of this immune surveillance is compromised. Hence this fungus is a frequent cause of irritating yeast infections such as &amp;quot;thrush&amp;quot;. It also causes life-threatening bloodstream infections in weak and vulnerable patients, often undoing the excellent work done by cancer treatment and intensive care medicine. Indeed, in some patient groups, over 40% of these infections are fatal. As well as having a significant impact on human health, these infections have a significant economic impact. Despite the availability of reasonably effective antifungal drugs, bloodstream infections are estimated to extend the hospitalisation of patients by 22 days, increasing health care costs by over &amp;pound;20,000 per patient. As yet, no antifungal vaccines are available. Their development depends on an understanding of the mechanisms by which our immune system recognises and kills Candida cells.\n\nSignificant progress has been made however. Research from a number of laboratories (including our own) has revealed that immune cells recognise specific types of molecule on the Candida cell surface as &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;. After recognising these molecules (&amp;quot;pathogen-associated molecular patterns&amp;quot;), the immune cells generally swallow the Candida cells (a process called &amp;quot;phagocytosis&amp;quot;), and then kill them by subjecting the fungus to a battery of toxic chemicals, thereby clearing the infection. This generally accepted view is based largely on experiments involving Candida albicans cells grown in the laboratory under well-defined culture conditions on specific growth media, and not cells grown in an infected host. Unfortunately, these laboratory growth media differ significantly from the conditions that Candida experiences during an infection. We have shown recently that changes in growth conditions significantly affect: (a) the architecture of the Candida cell surface; (b) recognition by our immune system; and (c) Candida's capacity to cause disease. Therefore our hypothesis is that during the onset and progression of an infection, Candida cells encounter and adapt to changes in host niches, thereby affecting their growth. This affects the expression and exposure of &amp;quot;pathogen-associated molecular patterns&amp;quot; on the fungal cell surface. We predict that these changes strongly influence the effectiveness of local immune surveillance, allowing more fungal cells to survive these host defences, thereby influencing disease progression and the outcome of the infection. In other words, fungal physiology resists host immunology. \n\nThe over-arching goal of our research programme is to test this hypothesis by defining the effects of Candida adaptation mechanisms upon the efficacy of immune surveillance and infection outcome. With the help of the three postdoctoral researchers, plus two PhD students provided by Aberdeen University, we will achieve this by combining our synergistic expertise in the analysis of Candida albicans nutrient and stress adaptation, the Candida cell surface, Candida pathogen-associated molecular patterns and immune recognition, the dynamics of phagocytosis and fungal killing, and Candida infection biology. We will integrate well-established molecular approaches with powerful new genomic technologies and state-of-the-art cellular imaging (many of which were developed in our labs). This research is essential if we are to properly understand anti-Candida immunity in the context of disease onset and progression. This knowledge will facilitate the development of effective anti-Candida vaccines and novel immunotherapies.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 4                                                       Europe and China both face the challenges of climate change and associated environmental degradation, and of finding ways in which to promote economic transition away from carbon-intensive economic and consumption patterns, and towards a green economy. The city is where these challenges are centred, and where solutions have to be found: cities are both producers of environmental externalities, and the locations where the negative effects of climate change will be felt most acutely. A promising approach focuses on treating new and existing cities as 'experimental areas' where transitions to a green economy can be trialled. Eco-cities and smart cities have been proposed as potential solutions to the need for a green economy: they are seen as 'socio-technical experiments' which are potential drivers for local, national and international environmental socio-economic change and transition.\n\nBoth China and several European countries are actively engaged in planning and building experimental cities focused on the green economy. Many of these projects combine elements of eco-city planning (focusing on the visible 'hardware' of environmental sustainability: planning, architecture, renewable energy and smart grid technologies, etc.), with 'smart city' planning (focusing is on 'software': information systems, social capital, knowledge transfer, etc.). We propose analysis of what we call the 'smart eco-city', defined as an experimental city which functions as a potential niche where both environmental and economic reforms can be tested and introduced in areas which are both spatially proximate (the surrounding region) and in an international context (through networks of knowledge, technology and policy transfer and learning).\n\nThe aim of this project is to provide the first systematic comparative analysis of green economy-focused eco-city projects in China and Europe. This will inform the identification of opportunities and pathways for shaping national and collaborative international urban and economic policy responses, engaging the state, the business sector and communities in delivering 'smart eco-city' projects that can promote the growth of the green economy.\n\nThe research addresses key issues: a.) how experimental cities have fared in terms of promoting successful transitions to a green economy in Europe and China since 2000; b.) how to evaluate success in smart eco-city initiatives; c.) what are the main obstacles to successful projects d.) what generalizable lessons can be drawn from successful smart eco-cities, in socio-economic and policy terms; e.) how knowledge can be effectively shared across the context of European and Chinese urban-economic policymaking for smart eco-cities.\n\nIn order to address these crucial issues our team will carry out international, interdisciplinary multi-method research which will include a total of eight in-depth smart eco-city case studies in China, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. This will involve documentary research as well as interviews with European and Chinese policymakers, businesspeople, financiers, local communities and other stakeholders. The project will also involve research aimed at building the first qualitative-quantitative database of smart eco-city projects: this will form the backbone of our policy toolkit and will be a state-of-the-art contribution to current knowledge on smart- and eco-city planning and policy.\n\nOur expected outcomes are: 1.) the first systematic comparative study of smart eco-city projects in Europe and China; 2.) the identification of criteria for the success of experimental city projects in stimulating the emergence and growth of the green economy; 3.) a true interdisciplinary partnership between China and Europe in the generation of new knowledge and data; 4.) the generation of new theory in the field of transition theory; and 5.) policy toolkits of use for beneficiaries involved in contemporary experimental smart eco-city projects.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 5                                                                           Cyclones and hurricanes exert a major influence on the structure and ecology of shallow water coral reefs. This occurs through the physical destruction of corals (especially branching coral species), with the resultant rubble being a major source of detrital reef framework carbonate. Ecologically, these high magnitude physical disturbance events also exert a profound influence on benthic habitat composition and diversity, and drive the remobilisation and distribution of reef-derived sediments - transporting such materials either shorewards into lagoons or onto beaches, or flushing sediment offshore into deeper water. Many future climate models predict an increasing frequency and intensity of such tropical storms, and thus data on the physical and ecological resilience of shallow water coral reefs is of significant scientific and management interest.\n\nVarious studies have examined the impact of such physical disturbance events on coral reefs, in many cases basing their findings only on post-impact assessments. In only a few cases have high quality pre- and post-impact data been available, and in most cases this has only been sufficient to consider the (albeit critically important) ecological transitions. It is extremely rare to have the opportunity to undertake multi-proxy assessments of physical disturbance events that can draw on pre-impact data covering not only the reef ecology, but also geomorphology (structure, elevation), contemporary sedimentology, and the late Holocene history of reef development (as preserved in core records). To be able to do this at a range of sites both immediately proximal to a cyclone track and at more distal sites, represents an unprecedented opportunity, especially where data is available from a range of nearshore to offshore depositional settings.\n\nHere we have such an opportunity, and one that will allow us to undertake multi-proxy assessments (geomorphical, ecological and sedimentological) of the changes induced by an especially high magnitude recent cyclone. The event in question, Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi, was a Category 5 cyclone (the highest category on a scale of 1-5) that made landfall on the Queensland coast of Australia, in the vicinity of Mission Beach and Tully, on 3rd Feb 2011. The eye of the storm was ~35 km wide, with a front stretching across ~650 km. Evidence from instrumentation that survived the event shows a central pressure of around 929hPa, with winds gusting up to 285 km/h, and with storm surge heights reaching at least 5 m. Yasi was thus one of the most powerful cyclones to have affected Queensland since records commenced. Previous cyclones of a comparable measured intensity include Cyclone Mahina (1899) in Princess Charlotte Bay ~350 km to the north, and the 1918 cyclones at Mackay and Innisfail.\n\nSpecifically, we are in a position, having undertaken detailed studies of the structure and ecology of a wide range of reefs in the immediate vicinity of the storm track and its landfall point, to be able to undertake a rapid post-impact assessment, and to compare this data with that collected (between 2006-2009) at the same sites. We are submitting this as an Urgency application because of the need to undertake such post-impact studies as soon as logistically possible. This is of critical importance in marine environments to ensure that as much of the evidence (both ecological and geomorphological) of the event is preserved. We are planning to undertake this study in August 2011, giving a 6 month lead in from this application (this is probably as soon as logistically possible given the need for the review process and subsequent travel planning). The timing will be such, so as to coincide with one of the winter low spring tide periods when site access is far easier. Based on existing post-storm recovery trajectories in other tropical regions we would anticipate such evidence being well preserved within the 6 month lead in time we are working to.</span>

While they are controlled by active pest management, fungi rapidly adjust and develop resistances. Thus, research on fungal specific and pathogenicity-relevant cellular processes is required to identify new targets for fungicide development. Fungi invade the host tissue by expanding at the end of their elongated cells. This process is named 'tip growth' and it involves the polar release of enzymes that participate in the formation of the fungal cell wall. We have recently reported that a particular fungal-specific myosin-chitin synthase-like protein (Mcs1) has a key role in tip growth in the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis. This protein is also found in many other pathogenic fungi, where it also essential for plant infection. In this project we will join up with an industrial partner, Syngenta Ltd., to identify regulators that control this important Mcs1 protein. We will elucidate the role of a so far unknown Mcs1 protein in the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch on wheat, which is the most devastating wheat pathogen in the UK and Europe. In addition, we will use our existing knowledge and molecular tools in U. maydis to identify new factors that control the function of Mcs1. When considered together the project promises to provide fundamental new insight into a fungal specific pathway, essential for plant infection. This will provide knowledge that will help to develop new fungicides and therefore is of high value to the agricultural biotechnology industry in the UK.</span>

The field of AM, also known also as 3D Printing, has expanded significantly over the last couple of decades across virtually all-industrial sectors due a number of key advantages that traditional manufacturing just cannot offer. These include mass customisation, geometrical complexity, tool-less manufacture and sustainable manufacturing. Among the companies using AM are GE (medical devices, and home appliance parts), Lockheed Martin and Boeing (aerospace and defense), Invisalign (dental devices) and LUXeXcel (lenses for light-emitting diodes, or LEDs). The worldwide revenue from 3D printing is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and exceed $21 billion by 2020, and has a potential of generating an economic impact of $230 billion to $550 billion per year by 2025. \n\nWhile the forecast for AM products is huge this will only be achieved if we can actually manufacture parts with the desired properties. The majority of polymeric AM research is however focused on low glass transition temperature (Tg) polymers such as Polyamide 11, 12 , Polycarbonate and Poly Lactic acid (PLA), due to their good processing characteristics (rheological, thermal and crystallization). For advanced, high value applications in aerospace, telecommunication and defense where harsh environmental conditions often exist (and in some key biomedical application) these low Tg polymers for AM are not acceptable so there is a real need to develop materials for these applications. Whilst a sufficiently high Tg polymer could offer the required high performance, nanocomposites with increased functionalities and potential combinations of properties such as high stiffness, strength, wear and specific thermal, electrical and microwave response can really transform the performance of AM components. The ability to manipulate other properties, such as rheological and thermal performance, by the addition of nanoparticles offers further potential advantages in terms of processing characteristics. \n\nThis proposal will examine the potential of inorganic fullerene-like (IF) tungsten disulfide (WS2) or IF-WS2 as nanofillers for high value, PAEK (Poly Aryl Ether Ketone) based products made via the AM processes of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The incorporation of IF particles has been shown to be efficient for improving thermal, mechanical and tribological properties of various thermoplastic polymers, such as polypropylene, nylon-6, poly(phenylene sulfide), poly(ether ether ketone). These nanocomposites were fabricated by simple melt-processing routes without the need for modifiers or surfactants . IF-WS2 have been proven to exhibit extremely high tribological performance in composites to reduce wear and coefficient of friction .These characteristics will also have important processability benefits for AM processes as will their dispersion characteristics which are superior to 1D and 2D nanoparticles. They are also the best shock absorbing cage structures known to mankind. Importantly, they are non-toxic, and thermally stable. \n\nWe will examine the two main AM processes for producing parts with engineering properties, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) in which a laser is used to melt and sinter powdered polymer into the final part and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) in which a polymer filament is melted in a heated nozzle and deposited in the required pattern to form the part.</span>

It involves the northward transport of warm surface waters to the high latitude North Atlantic, where they cool (releasing heat to the atmosphere), sink and flow back southwards at depth. Changes in the AMOC are thought to alter global temperature and precipitation patterns, regional sea-level, and socio-economically important marine ecosystems. \n\nThere are concerns regarding the strength and stability of AMOC in the future. This is because predicted surface ocean warming and freshening could weaken the formation of dense water that helps drive the AMOC. Earlier research suggests that the AMOC may have different stable states, raising the possibility that the AMOC could rapidly switch to a weaker, or even an 'off', state, having a severe impact on global climate. IPCC models do not predict an abrupt weakening of the AMOC under typical 21st century scenarios; yet there are suggestions that current climate models may be excessively stable.\n\nNERC and the international community have invested heavily in monitoring the AMOC, including the implementation of the RAPID array since 2004 and more recently the OSNAP array. Since observations began in 2004, AMOC has weakened at a rate ten times faster than predicted by most models. Yet the extent to which this decline can be attributed to natural multi-decadal variability is uncertain. The limited time span of the RAPID array means we are unable to gain an understanding of the nature of AMOC variability on timescales longer than interannual-to-decadal. Therefore we must turn to geological archives to reconstruct AMOC changes beyond the instrumental record. Yet there are no existing records to provide perspective on recent AMOC variability at multi-decadal and longer timescales. \n\nUsing recent, novel techniques to constrain past variability, coupled with exceptional sediment archives, ReconAMOC will constrain past AMOC variability on decadal to centennial timescales, generating records for the last 7000 years that will become benchmark constraints on AMOC behaviour. We will focus on the past 7000 years because the climate was not dramatically different to the present day, and remnant glacial ice sheets had melted away so that the major features of deep Atlantic circulation were broadly similar to modern. \n\nReconAMOC deploys a twin approach that utilizes (i) the characteristic subsurface temperature AMOC fingerprint, and (ii) the deep western boundary current response to AMOC change. We have verified these new paleoclimate approaches against variability in the instrumental record and demonstrated their applicability through an extensive pilot study. ReconAMOC is therefore a low risk yet ambitious project, bringing together an international team of collaborators, that will meet a long-sought and much-needed requirement of a wide range of climate scientists and modellers. \n\nReconAMOC will enable testing and improvement of model simulations of AMOC that help facilitate assessment of the vulnerability of the AMOC to climate change, and permit the investigation of the role of AMOC on other components of the climate system. The topics addressed by ReconAMOC are key research targets at national UK (e.g. identified strategic science themes and goals within the NERC strategy) and international (e.g. CMIP6, IMAGESII, SCOR, PAGES, IODP and NSF) levels. Specifically, the ReconAMOC proposal builds on the NERC programmes RAPID, RAPID-WATCH, and RAPID-AMOC, in which interannual to multi-decadal variability in the AMOC is a central focus, as well as NERC programme ACSIS examining interannual to decadal climate variability in the Atlantic.</span>

The Truro Historical Project was originally designed to explore the city's history through the documents, artefacts and images that are found in the record offices, museums and similar institutions in the local area and beyond. These materials can illuminate much of the city's history, but they give only very limited insights into lives of the ordinary citizens of the city and, curiously, they are of limited help in revealing the period of intense change in Truro's very recent history since 1945. Anna Green of the Department of History at the University of Exeter's Cornwall Campus, not only has extensive experience of conducting and directing large-scale community oral histories, she is also responsible for the Public History stream of the syllabus, under which students undertake project and dissertation work with local museums and similar organisations. Green's expertise and ability to direct student project work in directions that could contribute significantly to illuminating the context of Truro's postwar history, suggest very clearly that a medium-sized community oral history project could extend our understanding of those aspects of Truro's history for which the documentary sources were most problematic. In selecting where and how many oral histories to undertake, the director of the Truro Historical Project and Green have elected to undertake life histories of the elderly residents of five postwar housing estates (originally built by the local authority) and to work in collaboration with Truro City Council's Community Development Partnership, which has made excellent progress on three of these estates and is looking to expand its activities on the other two. By collaborating with this initiative, the community worker can both introduce the historians to her elderly contacts, but also use the networks of the elderly to extend her own network and to make progress in developing community awareness and solidarity on the two 'new' estates. The Truro Historical project has already planned and budgeted for an exhibition in the city centre at the end of its term (summer 2010), but by adding a new element that celebrates the lives and contributions of those inhabitants that are most difficult to access and, even more important, by ensuring that the oral history element of the expanded exhibition can be taken to the community centres on these estates, this initiative will ensure that the primary goals of the Historical Project (an accessible, enjoyable history of the city) the Community Development Partnership (to empower the inhabitants of these estates and celebrate their contribution to Truro life) and of the University History Department (to work with the local community in constructive partnership) are met successfully.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2  An individual's susceptibility to fungal infection is heightened by factors that attenuate immune surveillance. Considerable progress has been made in defining the mechanisms by which innate immune cells recognise and clear Candida albicans, the major fungal pathogen of humans. These depend on the recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). To date, C. albicans PAMPs have generally been defined using fungal cells grown under standardised conditions in vitro that do not accurately reflect dynamic host microenvironments. In reality, the fungus is a moving target. It adapts to host signals such as local nutrients, thermal fluctuations and iron limitation by altering its cell surface. We recently showed that the adaptation of C. albicans to physiologically relevant carbon sources triggers dramatic changes in cell wall architecture, immune recognition and virulence. Therefore, in this programme we will test our hypothesis that fungal adaptation within host niches influences the efficacy of local immune surveillance, thereby strongly impacts on disease progression. First, we will establish how fungal adaptation impacts on PAMP exposure at the C. albicans cell surface by combining targeted molecular dissection in C. albicans and the host with genomic-wide screens and biochemical characterisation. Next we will define how these changes influence the dynamics of Candida-phagocyte interactions by combining precise molecular intervention with state-of-the-art 4-D video microscopy. We will also exploit new synthetic reporters to determine the impact of these changes on disease progression in well-established infection models. Furthermore, the molecular characterisation of C. albicans cells from patient samples will establish the relevance of these major findings to human infection. In this way we will establish a key principle in infection biology - that fungal adaptation resists host immunology.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 6       This is an industrial partnership project that will analyze the structural and regulatory environment of the fungal-specific myosin-chitin synthase Mcs1 during exocytosis. We have recently shown that the myosin motor domain (MMD) of Mcs1 in the corn pathogen U. maydis (UmMcs1) is deispensible for delivery of vesicles, but serves local roles at the apical growth site. Unpublished data show that the MMD is required to prolong the tethering time of vesicles at the plasma membrane, and that altered pausing times result in defects in Mcs1 exocytosis and reduced virulence of the fungus. In collaboration with Syngenta Ltd. we have identified a Mcs1-like enzyme in the wheat leaf blotch fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, named MgMcs1, which also localizes to the apical plasma membrane and is required for cellular morphogenesis. In a first part of the project, the biological function of MgMcs1 will be characterized by generating mutants in the motor domain and by complementation of the null mutant phenotypes in M. graminicola and U. maydis. In a second part, a two-hybrid screen is planned to identify interacting partners of the MMD of MgMcs1 and UmMcs1. This will be done with particular emphasize on a loop that is inserted in the MMD and that shows sequence conservation among Mcs1-proteins. In a third part, existing U. maydis mutants will be characterized that combine hypersensitivity to the chitin synthase inhibitor NikkomycinZ, severely attenuated plant pathology and abnormal GFP-Mcs1 localization. All these attributes are characteristic for mutant defective in Mcs1 exocytosis, suggesting that these mutants might lead to the identification of regulatory factors involved in Mcs1-dependent exocytosis. The characterization of all new factors derived from the two-hybrid screen or the complementation approach in the evolutionary distant U. maydis and M. graminicola will allow a more general approach in understanding this pathogenicity related exocytosis mechanism.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2  Our programme addresses an understudied issue of central importance to fungal infection. We will generate valuable new information about the impact of fungal adaptation upon host immunity and infection outcome. This will benefit companies interested in developing anti-Candida vaccines and therapies, clinicians specialising in medical microbiology, the general public, and our researchers. To maximise our impact in these areas we will continue to:\n1. Ensure that our scientific observations and datasets are disseminated effectively.\n2. Protect and exploit any valuable intellectual property that arises during the project.\n3. Contribute to public outreach programmes with a view to enhancing the public understanding of science.\n4. Further enhance our collaborations in the UK and abroad.\n5. Provide an excellent and multidisciplinary training for our PDRAs.\n\nDISSEMINATION:\nWe will continue to disseminate our findings to academics, companies and clinicians through: publications in leading journals; presentations at international conferences on molecular biology, immunology and infection biology; the release of large datasets to public repositories; collaborations with international colleagues, clinical mycologists and companies; and through our personal websites. \n\nIP &amp;amp; TRANSLATION:\nWe will regularly review our work to identify potentially valuable IP with our Research and Innovation Office. In particular, we will protect information that might lead to the development of anti-Candida vaccines or novel immunotherapies that complement the limited number of antifungal drugs currently available to treat systemic fungal infections. The commercial translation of valuable findings will be achieved with help from our extensive and longstanding links with SMEs and pharmaceutical companies. These activities will be financed by our MRC Confidence in Concept Fund and Wellcome Trust-funded Institutional Strategic Support Fund and BBSRC Excellence With Impact award.\n\nIn the longer term, our programme will facilitate the development of more effective antifungal therapies. This clinical impact will be realised through Erwig (a practicing clinician), Mihai Netea and Adilia Warris (a clinical mycologist in the Aberdeen Fungal Group), and our many clinical colleagues in the medical mycology field.\n\nPUBLIC OUTREACH:\nThis programme will be of interest to the general public because many individuals suffer Candida infections. [This fungus is a frequent cause of oral and vaginal thrush. (Most women suffer an episode of vaginitis in their lifetime. Over 75 million women suffer &amp;gt;4 episodes/year.) Also, C. albicans is a common cause of life-threatening systemic infections that, even with current antifungal drugs, display high morbidities (&amp;gt;40%).] We will continue our public outreach activities with support from our Aberdeen University Public Engagement Unit and Press Office. We disseminate information via our Aberdeen Fungal Group website and Facebook page, and through our Wellcome Trust Strategic Award website. This includes information about controversial issues as well as fungal immunology and medical mycology to counteract public exposure to misinformation and questionable treatments. In the longer term the public will benefit through the development of improved antifungal therapies (above).\n\nCOLLABORATION:\nThis programme involves new US collaborators. They extend our large collaborative network that includes partners in North America, European Networks, UK Wellcome Trust Strategic Consortia, and the Scottish Infectious Disease Research Initiative.\n\nTRAINING:\nOur researchers will receive an excellent multidisciplinary training in medical mycology, molecular biology, genomics, phagocyte biology and infection biology. Their career development will be enhanced by our collaborative networks, regular mentoring, and training in transferable skills of relevance to diverse sectors. This will build UK capacity in this under-represented field.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 4          The project will have an impact in informing policymaking as well as business and community engagement in and around experimental smart eco-city projects in the UK, other European countries and in China. Our research project involves sustained and detailed engagement with beneficiaries in the UK, China, the Netherlands, France and Germany, and will have an impact on:\n\nPolicy beneficiaries: in the UK these will be a.) policymakers at the national level, especially those concerned with urban and economic planning, or with environmental planning (e.g. Department for Communities and Local Government; Department for Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs); b.) private sector-focused government bodies, such as UK Trade and Industry; c.) local government bodies at the level of individual case studies, including local councils. These beneficiaries will benefit from engagement in the project through published outputs and from attendance at community-focused stakeholder impact workshops (see 'community beneficiaries' below), policy workshops, funded attendance at international practitioner-academic conferences such as the UN World Urban Forum summit in 2016; and the project website and webinars. \n\nBusiness beneficiaries: UK businesses such as urban development and design firms, engineering corporations, or consultancies, and including industry-focused bodies such as the China-Britain Business Council. Business beneficiaries will benefit from published, workshop and webinar impact mechanisms mentioned above (in the discussion on policy beneficiaries), as well as from a specific, business-focused output: an Executive Summary Report targeting business impact, informed through engagement with businesspeople and corporations throughout the project's lifetime, therefore making sure that the report targets topics, issues and solutions relevant to UK businesses. \n\nCommunity beneficiaries: these will include local community stakeholders at case study sites. These beneficiaries represent those who will be most directly affected by smart eco-city planning projects and policies. It is expected that most of these beneficiaries will be (in the UK) located in and around the Thames Gateway Eco-Region case study sites. Community beneficiaries will include NGOs, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. They will benefit from all the activities mentioned above, with a particular focus on the stakeholder impact meetings, which will be held at case study sites during case study research: in the UK, these meetings will mostly be in and around the Thames Gateway regions, and will focus on local stakeholders from communities and civil society organizations (as well as local government).\n\nPolicy, business and community beneficiaries will benefit from the provision made within the project for these beneficiaries to participate at stakeholder impact meetings; policy workshops in London and Beijing; and at panels and conference discussion sessions to be held at the UN World Urban Forum summit in 2016 and at the Eco-Cities World Summit in 2017, featuring engagement with academic and policy audiences, as well as with businesses. These events will see beneficiary attendees from other European countries and from China, funded by respective national project teams, and will therefore be key knowledge sharing, mutual learning and networking opportunities for policymakers, businesses and community stakeholders. Those beneficiaries participating in policy workshops in China will benefit from case study site visits to selected smart eco-cities, enabling on-the-ground policy and practice learning.\n\nFinally, we aim to achieve broader societal impact through enabling the construction of cleaner and smarter urban economies and environments, thus helping to ensure successful smart eco-city projects, the emergence of a sustainable green economy, and better, more prosperous, and environmentally resilient communities.</span>

This has particular relevance because, in contrast to their clear-water, offshore counterparts, these muddy inner-shelf reefs are typically poorly lithified (weakly cemented and unbound depositional structures) and have thus been the subject of much academic speculation regarding their long-term preservation potential. In a recent regional scale assessment, we identified a clear break in reef-building on the inner-shelf of the GBR between about 4,500 to 2000 years BP. One hypothesis is that many of the reef structures that may have existed through this mid-Holocene interval were actually reworked during high energy events - this research on the impacts of such a high magnitude event as Cyclone Yasi will allow us to test such ideas; 2) because the study will allow us to examine whether distinct storm depositional horizons form and are preserved in the sediment record under such extreme conditions. If so, the potential to develop diagnostic indicator tools for such events, and which could be applied to other core records, will be of consider interest to this 'user' group. \n\nMarine managers - because the data will provide unprecedented knowledge on the resilience and vulnerability of the reefs that exist within what has typically been a very poorly studied area of the Great Barrier Reef Shelf. We have a unique, pre-existing dataset that will allow us to provide information on this issue for a range of cyclone influenced sites. \n\nThe PI on the project will gain further invaluable and applied research experience and continue to foster research links with the international research community - especially those in Australia.\n\nThe RA to be employed on the project will gain invaluable experience that will provide a solid and wide-ranging basis for subsequent doctoral research, or for field/laboratory-based employment in the environmental sector.</span>

The human world population is constantly increasing - projections indicate that cereal production will need to increase by 40% by 2030 to help feed mankind. Currently, between 30-50% of all crop yield is lost due to pests and diseases (and can exceed 80% without effective pest management). Fungi are responsible for 7-15% of this loss, with some specific pathogens being particularly important. Mycosphaerella graminicola, the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch on wheat, can cause up to 40% yield loss and is therefore considered the most devastating wheat pathogen in Western Europe. Whilst yield loss is generally considered moderate (when appropriate management strategies are used), there is a significant risk that rapidly-emerging resistance will provide a significant threat to current yields. Thus, developing new fungicides is a continuous challenge, and this study will provide knowledge critical to the future development of novel fungal pathogen control measures by provision of key molecular tools for two fungal model systems, the corn pathogen U. maydis and the wheat pathogen M. graminicola). This project focuses on how to disrupt the processes by which fungi are able to infect their hosts. Specifically, we intend to provide understanding of a pathogenicity-related process and, alongside, a toolkit for the development of fungal control strategies using Mcs1 enzymes; it is known that fungal-specific Mcs1 has an essential role in the virulence of numerous plant pathogenic fungi. Currently, we do not have any knowledge about the regulatory and structural environment that controls the activity of Mcs1 at sites of exocytosis. This project aims to address this lack of knowledge using economically important models. The proposed work is supported directly by Syngenta through the Industrial Partnership Award scheme which demonstrates its relevance to, and commitment from, industry. Through our partnership with Syngenta and appropriate publication we will provide fundamental and industry-orientated knowledge necessary to investigate the development of Mcs1-mediated fungal control strategies.</span>

They will gain an understanding of the industrial requirements for additive manufacturing materials and how processing influences part properties. They will also gain an understanding of the stringent requirements placed on product performance for the aerospace sector. Through the dissemination and outreach activities in the proposal they will improve communication skills and increase personal networks. Secondary school students will benefit from the proposed outreach activities. Additive manufacturing provides an exciting and interesting topic for promoting STEM. The applications envisaged in this proposal in the aerospace and biomedical sectors should also prove to be attractive to the students and help further engage them with STEM and with industry.\n\nSociety will benefit through (i) the ability to replace metal parts with lighter polymer nanocomposite parts in aerospace and other transport applications (ii) the potential of these new materials to reduce wear in biomedical implants such as hip joints (iii) better product design enabled by the additive manufacturing of complex products in high performance materials\n\nThe economy will benefit via the availability of a new range of high performance materials for the additive manufacturing industry. Aerospace and biomedical sectors requiring better performing, lightweight, multifunctional materials in relatively small quantities or in customised designs will also benefit. The worldwide revenue from additive manufacturing is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and to exceed $21 billion by 2020. These new materials will contribute to this projected growth.</span>

Policy makers and associated stakeholders (including environmental organisations and private corporations) involved in marine and climate strategy decisions over a range of timescales. \n\nFuture projections of climate change (derived from global climate models) are used to develop not only climate policy, but also a wide range of other long-term strategies - such as for the management of marine ecosystems and resources. It is necessary to assess whether these projections adequately capture the instability of the AMOC and the abrupt climate change that could ensue as a result of passing tipping points. At present there is a relatively limited suite of proxy reconstructions that are available for this task and there is a crucial need to expand this offering, so that a fuller understanding of the complex mechanisms and feedbacks acting throughout the climate system can be gained and predictive capabilities improved. The ReconAMOC project will provide previously unavailable information on the role that the AMOC plays in decadal to millennial scale climate change. The reconstructions produced will help validate and improve the climate models that are used to predict future climate change and its impacts (e.g. CMIP6 models). Hence, they are of direct policy relevance for national and international governmental climate change programmes, and will help provide society with the information it requires to manage the future global environment. \n\n2. School students. \n\nUnderstanding past climate changes now forms a part of the Key Stage 3 curriculum, and the expertise of university researchers can be used to help inform and educate school students and their teachers on areas of topical research. By working with schools to help educate pupils, university researchers can help enthuse a younger generation about Earth's climate system and climate change. ReconAMOC will develop teaching tools through collaboration with two schools that can then be disseminated more widely to aid the education of upper school Geographers. \n\n3. General public understanding of science\n\nThe widespread international media coverage (TV, radio, press) of our recent publication (Thornalley et al., 2018, Nature) demonstrates that we can communicate to the lay community that high-resolution investigations into global changes in the recent past can be exciting and relevant. We will show how changes in the circulation of the Atlantic play an important role in controlling societally relevant, decadal to century time scale variability in the climate system.</span>
